# Pig Latin

### Objective

Translate a string to pig latin.

Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".

If a word begins with a vowel, "way" is added to the end.

_Strings are assumed to be english words in all lowercase._
